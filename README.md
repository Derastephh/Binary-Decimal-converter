# Binary-Decimal-converter
This Python script provides a simple command-line interface for converting binary numbers to decimal and decimal numbers to binary. The script is designed to be used with the command line, allowing users to easily convert between binary and decimal representations.

Usage:

    Convert binary to decimal: python bin_dec_conv.py -b 110111
    Convert decimal to binary: python bin_dec_conv.py -d 334

You can use the --help command to see information about the available options:
